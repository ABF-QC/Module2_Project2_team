# Classification Project 

## Introduction
For this project, you will work with a [dataset](churn.xlsx) containing information from a fictional telco company that provided home phone and internet services to 7043 customers in California in Q3. 

It indicates which customers have left, stayed, or signed up for their service. Multiple important demographics are included for each customer, as well as a Satisfaction Score, Churn Score, and Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) index.

More information can be found [here](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/businessanalytics/blogs/steven-macko/2019/07/11/telco-customer-churn-1113).

Churn analysis is a method used by organizations to understand the rate at which customers discontinue their business with a company and to identify the reasons and factors contributing to this decision. This type of analysis is crucial in many industries, such as telecommunications, retail, finance, and any subscription-based service.

**Your goal is to create a model to predict whether or not a customer will churn.**

Here are the criteria your project needs to meet:

### Project Submission
- You will upload your completed project in a PUBLIC Github repository in your account.
- Your repository MUST include:
    - a README.md page that includes a description and summary of your analysis.
    - The completed .ipynb notebook with your analysis.
- Your notebook has to be organized and clean. Break down your steps, and follow coding best practices.

### Notebook Criteria
1. Your analysis needs to include an EDA section. 
    - Keep an eye on important features and potential issues (missing data, incorrect datatypes, etc.,).
    - Use visualization to identify trends/patterns.
2. Clean and prepare your data as necessary.
3. Use Feature-Engineering where necessary. Always include an explanation of why you did or did not perform a step.
4. You must compare at least 3 classification models.
5. You must choose a validation scheme (simple or cross-validation).
6. Explain which features you have chosen for your final model and why.
7. You must try your final model by using it to make new predictions on input that you provide.

## Good luck!
